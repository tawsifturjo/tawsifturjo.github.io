### 1. EEG-Based Memory Recall Detection Using LSTM and Spectrogram-CNN Models

<div class="project-container">
  <div class="project-text">
    <p>
      This project focuses on detecting memory recall in human subjects using EEG signals. I processed the PEERS dataset (University of Pennsylvania) to classify successfully recalled versus forgotten words. Time-domain LSTM models and frequency-domain CNNs (on spectrograms) were trained and compared. This approach showed promise for cognitive neuroscience applications, including brain-computer interfaces and early diagnosis of memory-related disorders.

### 2. Quantum-Inspired Optimization Techniques for EEG Signal Denoising

<div class="project-container">
  <div class="project-text">
    <p>
      In this study, I applied quantum-inspired metaheuristics to optimize EEG signal denoising using FIR filters. The method preserved critical neural patterns while reducing artifact-induced noise. Techniques from compressed sensing and non-convex optimization were combined with domain knowledge in neurophysiology. This research bridges classical signal processing with principles from quantum computing and optimization.

### 3. Spectrogram-Based Classification of Alcohol Consumption Effects on EEG

<div class="project-container">
  <div class="project-text">
    <p>
      This research explored how alcohol consumption affects brain activity using spectrograms generated from multichannel EEG recordings. A CNN-based model was trained on time-frequency features to classify alcoholic vs non-alcoholic subjects. The work also analyzed localized effects on frontal and parietal lobes, demonstrating the potential for machine learning to support substance impact studies in neuroscience.
