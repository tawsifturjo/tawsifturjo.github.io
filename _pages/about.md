    <h2>Research Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET). My academic and research interests lie in the intersection of <strong>machine learning, deep learning, EEG signal processing</strong>, and <strong>quantum information science</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have worked extensively on EEG-based cognitive state classification, focusing on memory encoding and retrieval using time-series deep learning models like LSTM and GRU. My work includes the design of hybrid models combining LSTM with traditional ML classifiers (e.g., XGBoost) for improved performance and interpretability. I also explored spectrogram-based approaches for visual feature extraction and classification using CNNs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently, I’ve extended my interests to <strong>physics-informed machine learning and quantum computing</strong>, particularly in areas like quantum sensing and near-term quantum algorithms. I’m currently preparing a research publication on EEG-based memory recall modeling using the PEERS dataset from the University of Pennsylvania.
