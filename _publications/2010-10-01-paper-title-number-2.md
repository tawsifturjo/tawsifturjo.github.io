excerpt: 'Emotion detection aims to interpret
emotions through data like text, voice, and
physiological signals, which holds significant potential
for monitoring mental health and human-computer
interaction. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a noninvasive technique recording brain activity and offers
unique insights for real-time emotion detection. This
study evaluates classifying emotions (i.e. positive,
negative, neutral) in EEG using deep learning,
emphasizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
After going through the preprocessing part, the timefrequency representations along with random
transformations were created as inputs to the CNN
architecture by a short-time Fourier transform of the
EEG signals from the SEED dataset. The spectrograms
have been processed to have better outcomes, and they
showed an overall accuracy of 99.80% in detecting the
emotions classes. Also, processed spectrograms, along
with the actual spectrograms, have been fed together to
the CNN model as a hypothesis, and there we achieved
an overall accuracy of 66%, depicting that the usage of
processed spectrograms can be a potential field of study
to recognize emotions from EEG signals'
